3. Even Santa is automating!
4. Hashlib is a very handy encoder and decoder.
5. Pay attention to the differences between parts.
6. Handy regex statements can be very satisfying.
7. Python's bitwise complement works differently to how you'd expect.
8. Always check for end-of-line bugs.
9. I'm so glad that brute force was sufficient here...
10. Regex can make logic much simpler.
11. Just end a loop instead of repeatedly continuing.
